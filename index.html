									<h3>TensorFlow - Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef</h3>
								</div>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/plots/ensemble_models.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the world's largest coral reef and home to 1500 species 
									of fish, 400 species of corals and a lot more variety of other sea life. 
									However, currently the reef is under threat, in part because of the overpopulation of one 
									particular starfish. The coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish is the type 
									of starfish that eats the coral. The Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) is one of the few main 
									factors that is responsible for coral loss in the great barrier reef.
									A few COTS on a reef might be beneficial for the biological diversity, 
									as they keep down the growth of fast-growing coral species and thus will 
									keep space for other coral species. Nevertheless, currently the population of COTS is 
									growing in such a fast pace, that there is more coral being eating than it has a chance 
									to grow back. Their population can break out to thousands of starfish on individual reefs, 
									and eating up most of the coral and leaving behind a white-scarred reef that will take years 
									to recover. With the use of an object detection algorithm it is possible to detect them, since 
									the COTS are among some of the largest starfish species. On average 25-35cm, but they can grow 
									up to a size of 80cm in diameter. With this size, it makes them easier to spot on a reef. 
									So one way of improving the efficiency and scale at which marine scientists survey for COTS, is 
									to implement AI-driven environmental surveys.<br>
									Two type of Convolutional Neural Networks has been implemented during this research: Faster R-CNN 
									and YOLOv5. Furthermore, several Ensemble methods has been explored such as 
									<span class="bolded">NMS</span>(Non-maximum Suppression), 
									<span class="bolded">Soft-NMS</span> and <span class="bolded">WBF</span>(Weighted Boxes Fusion).<br>
									The full research paper includes: data analysis, data preparation, methods and results. <br>
									The research paper is available at Researchgate: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358638369_Protect_the_Great_Barrier_Reef_Identifying_starfish_in_real-time_by_an_object_detection_model?channel=doi&linkId=620cd0f2c5934228f96fcca4&showFulltext=true">Research paper</a>.

										<h3>Azure Machine Learning Studio - Model Deployment</h3>
									</div>
									<p>
										Manufy offers a service(platform) where sellers of products can interact with manufacturers, using a chat service to communicate. 
										However, some of the chat messages violate Manufyâ€™s policies and are illegal. Therefore, the messages needs to be evaluated automatically as they are sent. 
										With the use of NLP techniques and other feature engineering tasks, we managed to develop a model that labels incoming messages. 
										Besides the feature engineering and developing the model, I was fully responsible of deploying the model as an endpoint in Azure Machine Learning studio (blue-green deployment). 
										I used Docker, in order to develop and deploy. The pipeline in Azure (that exists off: container instances, Azure Queues and Azure functions) is able to perform inferencing with the use of the existing endpoint in Azure ML studio. 
										Furthermore, I was responsible for cloud engineering tasks like: setting-up and managing Cosmos databases in Azure. During this project Git was used to develop.</p>
